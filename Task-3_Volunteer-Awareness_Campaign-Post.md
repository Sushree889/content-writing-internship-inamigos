> **"Loves to click smiles of children & cuddle strays? Be the reason behind a smile, not just the one capturing it."**

Some smiles don't wait to be posed — they bloom when kindness walks in.

At **InAmigos Foundation**, we don’t just teach. We listen, play, care, and create spaces where love lives loud. With projects like **BachpanShala**, we're turning forgotten corners into hope-filled classrooms.

But behind every shining child’s face is a **volunteer** who decided that compassion is their purpose.

💛 If you believe in empathy, in giving back, in sitting down beside someone and saying, *“I see you”* — this is your sign.
